/*  -- LAPACK auxiliary routine (version 3.0) --   
       Univ. of Tennessee, Univ. of California Berkeley, NAG Ltd.,   
       Courant Institute, Argonne National Lab, and Rice University   
       October 31, 1992   


    Purpose   
    =======   

    DLAEV2 computes the eigendecomposition of a 2-by-2 symmetric matrix   
       [  A   B  ]   
       [  B   C  ].   
    On return, RT1 is the eigenvalue of larger absolute value, RT2 is the   
    eigenvalue of smaller absolute value, and (CS1,SN1) is the unit right   
    eigenvector for RT1, giving the decomposition   

       [ CS1  SN1 ] [  A   B  ] [ CS1 -SN1 ]  =  [ RT1  0  ]   
       [-SN1  CS1 ] [  B   C  ] [ SN1  CS1 ]     [  0  RT2 ].   

    Arguments   
    =========   

    A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION   
            The (1,1) element of the 2-by-2 matrix.   

    B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION   
            The (1,2) element and the conjugate of the (2,1) element of   
            the 2-by-2 matrix.   

    C       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION   
            The (2,2) element of the 2-by-2 matrix.   

    RT1     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION   
            The eigenvalue of larger absolute value.   

    RT2     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION   
            The eigenvalue of smaller absolute value.   

    CS1     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION   
    SN1     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION   
            The vector (CS1, SN1) is a unit right eigenvector for RT1.   

    Further Details   
    ===============   

    RT1 is accurate to a few ulps barring over/underflow.   

    RT2 may be inaccurate if there is massive cancellation in the   
    determinant A*C-B*B; higher precision or correctly rounded or   
    correctly truncated arithmetic would be needed to compute RT2   
    accurately in all cases.   

    CS1 and SN1 are accurate to a few ulps barring over/underflow.   

    Overflow is possible only if RT1 is within a factor of 5 of overflow.   
    Underflow is harmless if the input data is 0 or exceeds   
       underflow_threshold / macheps.
