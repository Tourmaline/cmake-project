       Univ. of Tennessee, Univ. of California Berkeley, NAG Ltd.,   
       Courant Institute, Argonne National Lab, and Rice University   
       October 31, 1992   


    Purpose   
    =======   

    DLAE2  computes the eigenvalues of a 2-by-2 symmetric matrix   
       [  A   B  ]   
       [  B   C  ].   
    On return, RT1 is the eigenvalue of larger absolute value, and RT2   
    is the eigenvalue of smaller absolute value.   

    Arguments   
    =========   

    A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION   
            The (1,1) element of the 2-by-2 matrix.   

    B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION   
            The (1,2) and (2,1) elements of the 2-by-2 matrix.   

    C       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION   
            The (2,2) element of the 2-by-2 matrix.   

    RT1     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION   
            The eigenvalue of larger absolute value.   

    RT2     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION   
            The eigenvalue of smaller absolute value.   

    Further Details   
    ===============   

    RT1 is accurate to a few ulps barring over/underflow.   

    RT2 may be inaccurate if there is massive cancellation in the   
    determinant A*C-B*B; higher precision or correctly rounded or   
    correctly truncated arithmetic would be needed to compute RT2   
    accurately in all cases.   

    Overflow is possible only if RT1 is within a factor of 5 of overflow.   
    Underflow is harmless if the input data is 0 or exceeds   
       underflow_threshold / macheps.
