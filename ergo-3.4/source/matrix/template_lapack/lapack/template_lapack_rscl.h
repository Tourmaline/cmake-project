/*  -- LAPACK auxiliary routine (version 3.0) --   
       Univ. of Tennessee, Univ. of California Berkeley, NAG Ltd.,   
       Courant Institute, Argonne National Lab, and Rice University   
       September 30, 1994   


    Purpose   
    =======   

    DRSCL multiplies an n-element real vector x by the real scalar 1/a.   
    This is done without overflow or underflow as long as   
    the final result x/a does not overflow or underflow.   

    Arguments   
    =========   

    N       (input) INTEGER   
            The number of components of the vector x.   

    SA      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION   
            The scalar a which is used to divide each component of x.   
            SA must be >= 0, or the subroutine will divide by zero.   

    SX      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension   
                           (1+(N-1)*abs(INCX))   
            The n-element vector x.   

    INCX    (input) INTEGER   
            The increment between successive values of the vector SX.   
            > 0:  SX(1) = X(1) and SX(1+(i-1)*INCX) = x(i),     1< i<= n
