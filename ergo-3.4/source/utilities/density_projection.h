/** load_density_and_project_sparse loads one or two density matrices (depending

    densityFileName. 

    The projection is done as follows:
    First, a matrix R is computed. 
    R is the overlap matrix between the two basis sets.
    Then RT * P * R is computed, where P is the starting guess density matrix
    read from file.
    To get a final projected density one could then multiply by S_inv from
    both sides, but to prepare for purification the matrix S*D*S is needed,
    so we skip multiplication by S_inv since it will anyway be cancelled out.
