/** Computes values of basis functions at specified points in

    @param gao matrix of computed b.f, values. Dimension is in C
    convention: [nderivatives][nvclen], where nderivatives is 1 for
    nder==0, 4 for nder==1.

    @param coor point coordinates.

    @param nblcnt so many continous blocks of basis functions will be computed.

    @param iblcks start and end indices of the b.fs shells. Computed shells
    are [iblcks[0], iblcks[1]).

    @param nder whether orbital derivatives are to be computed as
    well. Allowed values are 0 (no derivatives) and 1 (values and
    first order derivatives).

    @param bis structure describing the basis functions to be evaluated.
