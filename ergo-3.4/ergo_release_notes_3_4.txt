Ergo version 3.4 release notes, 2014-07-15
===================================================

The following changes were made compared to the previous version:

- Implemented gradient gradient/forces computation (only
  Hellmann-Feynman forces; no Pulay correction implemented so far).

- Optimized integral code; critical parts of Coulomb and HF exchange
  matrix construction routines are now significantly faster, at least
  on some architectures.

- Renamed some local variables in integrals/integrals_hermite.cc to
  fix problem on Mips/Mips64 architectures, where identifiers like
  R3000/R4000 caused problems.

- Bugfixes and code cleanup.
